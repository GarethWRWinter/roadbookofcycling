## Why I Wax My Chain, And Why You Probably Should Too

There are two types of cyclists.

Those who clean black paste off their cassette with an old toothbrush.

And those who do not.

This is the story of how I became the second type.

It starts, as most good things do, in Manchester.

## Manchester to London: 360km of Reality

![](../../assets/blog/uploads/gareth-winter-manchester-to-london-harry-dowdney.jpg)

Manchester to London *(founded by Rapha’s Simon Mottram)* is not a lab test.

It’s rain.

Grit.

B-roads.

Fatigue.

It is 12 hours of drivetrain exposure to everything the British road network can throw at you.

Before waxing, I would finish rides like that with a chain like a cement mixer. 

A cassette that looked like a plasterer’s radio. Leave it overnight, and you wake up to surface rust by morning.

A drivetrain that required a full degreasing session. The “get your hazmat suit on and cover the ground with tarp.” kind. The kind that wilts nearby plant life and makes you question your life choices.

And the quiet suspicion I had just spent £50 worth of component life.

Then I switched to chain wax.

Specifically, <a href="https://silca.cc/en-gb/collections/chain-waxing-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
SILCA Secret Chain Blend, Hot Melt Wax.
</a>

What changed?

Not the weather.

Not the distance.

Not the watts.

The noise.

Silence.

Standard drip lube vs Hot Melt Wax is like comparing a chain smoker with a rattly cough and lungs like raisins, versus Wim Hof’s perfectly pure lungs that could seat a tubeless tyre with one exhale.

## The First Thing You Notice Is Not Speed

It’s silence.

A properly waxed chain does not sound lubricated.

It sounds absent.

That is not magic. That is friction reduction. 

Not witchcraft. Watt-craft.

Zero Friction Cycling, widely regarded as the most exhaustive independent drivetrain testing authority in the world, has stated:

> “Hot melt wax remains the benchmark for efficiency and wear performance in real-world testing.”

Their full 6000km block testing, which includes clean, dry contamination, wet contamination, and extreme contamination blocks, consistently shows immersive wax systems outperforming wet lubricants for both friction and wear.

Adam Kerin of Zero Friction Cycling also notes:

> “A poor lubricant choice or contaminated chain can cost upwards of 5 watts at 250 watts. That number increases as power increases.”

Friction Facts testing, reported through VeloNews, showed wax-based systems running nearly 6 watts faster than the worst oil lubricants after one hour in dirt and water.

Six watts is not marketing.

Six watts is a bike length at 50 kilometres per hour.

And over 360 kilometres, that compounds.

## But This Is Not Just Paraffin

This is where people oversimplify it.

They say “wax” and imagine candles.

<a href="https://silca.cc/en-gb/collections/chain-waxing-system/products/secret-chain-wax-blend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
SILCA’s Secret Chain Blend
</a> is not just refined paraffin.

It contains nano-scale tungsten disulfide, WS2.

That matters.

Tungsten disulfide has a significantly lower dynamic coefficient of friction than PTFE and molybdenum disulfide. It plates into the microscopic asperities of the chain surface. It does not just sit between metal surfaces; it modifies them.

SILCA describes it clearly:

> “Secret Chain Blend utilises nano-scale tungsten disulfide to fill surface imperfections and create an ultra-low friction, wear-resistant interface.”

Zero Friction Cycling’s efficiency testing of SILCA Hot Melt places it among the fastest lubricants tested at approximately 3.8 watts loss at 250 watts.

This is not generic wax.

It is a wax matrix carrying one of the most lubricious solid additives used in high-performance engineering applications.

You are not just reducing contamination.

You are reducing boundary friction at the metal interface.

That is a different conversation entirely.

## Manchester to London: Three Chains, One Winner

### Chain Number One: 2016

Manchester to London 2016. Back then, immersive waxing was fringe.

When I told my friend Liam Maybank, founder of Aerevolution and a proper UK time trial engine, that I was riding M2L, he offered to wax my chain for mates’ rates. £20. He promised durability and a few watts.

The process looked like Breaking Bad. Solvents. Home oven. Serious kitchen chemistry.

The forecast flipped. 2016 became a washout. I panic-bought Rapha’s Shadow jersey and bib shorts the day before. If I was going waterproof, so was my drivetrain.

The moment I clipped in, it felt different.

Not faster. Quieter.

I rode off the front with two riders in the first quarter. After a few hours in the rain, their drivetrains sounded like gravel grinders. Mine stayed silent.

That silence became fuel.

While their chains collected every grain of the North of England, mine kept shedding contamination.

I rode them off my wheel and spent the next six hours solo.

Low position. Rhythm. Mindset. Efficient pedalling.

When I reached London, my legs were ruined.

My drivetrain was not.

## Chain Number Two: 2017

I returned in 2017 and took the fastest time, despite a headwind for most of the 360 kilometres.

That year, I used Muc Off’s Nanochain, developed for Brad Wiggins’ Hour Record.

It worked.

But it was essentially single-use. A lot of money for one ride.

You could not repeat the treatment yourself.

With a hot melt system at home, you can.

You control the prep.

You control the interval.

You control the friction.

And as Zero Friction Cycling summarised in their long block testing:

“Immersive wax lubricants consistently demonstrate significantly lower wear rates than wet lubricants across contamination blocks.”

That matters in a 360km race.

### **Chain Number Three: 2022**

By 2022, I was fully committed.

Full SILCA Hot Melt system.

Fastest time again.

Same British weather lottery.

The chain was weatherproof, durable, silent.

The next day, it went back into the wax pot and came out as good as new.

Unlike my legs.

# Sa Calobra: Why 18 Seconds Matters

Manchester to London proved durability.

Sa Calobra proved obsession.

9.4 kilometres at 7%.

Sub-30 became a number that would not leave.

I had tried before.

30:47.

30:21.

30:12.

Each time, close enough to taste. Each time, far enough to hurt.

When you miss by 12 seconds, 18 seconds is not theory.

It is personal.

At roughly 300 watts sustained climbing, a 3-watt saving is around 1%.

One percent over 30 minutes is roughly 18 seconds.

Eighteen seconds is the difference between unfinished business and closure.

For my sub-30 attempt, everything was controlled.

Weight.

Tyre pressure.

Pacing.

Sleep.

Fuel.

Position.

Friction.

Fresh immersion in Secret Chain Blend.

Optimised for outright efficiency.

Top up with Super Secret the night before.

No drivetrain contamination.

No boundary friction penalty.

No excuses.

On previous attempts, around minute 18, doubt arrived. Cadence dropped. Torque increased. Resistance crept in.

When you are grinding at threshold, drivetrain losses are not abstract numbers. They are resistance you feel.

That day, everything felt direct. Clean. Mechanically quiet.

When I crossed the line and saw 29:53 on the clock, it was not relief.

It was validation.

Wax did not give me lungs.

It did not give me legs.

But it removed resistance at the metal interface.

Marginal gains stack.

And tungsten disulfide is not marginal.

## The Economics

Wax looks expensive at first.

But fewer chain replacements.

Longer cassette life.

Longer chainring life.

Zero Friction Cycling’s modelling shows drivetrain savings over 10,000 kilometres can reach four-figure sums on high-end groupsets when low-wear lubrication systems are used.

Expensive up front.

Cheaper over distance.

## What Does It Actually Cost?

Let’s address the obvious objection.

Yes, hot waxing has an upfront cost.

## Initial Setup

Approximate pricing:

* Secret Chain Blend 500g: **£40 / $40**
* Super Secret Drip: **£25 / $25**
* StripChip (6 chains): **£24 / $24**
* Chain Waxing System: **£100 / $100**

Total upfront:

**\~£189 / \~$189**

*(European pricing will be broadly comparable in EUR.)*

That sounds like a lot.

Now let’s break it down properly.

## Cost Per Wax

A 500g bag of wax costs about £40 / $40.

You reuse the same wax bath.

The actual wax that leaves the pot per immersion is only a few grams.

That works out at roughly:

**30p to 50p / $0.30 to $0.50 per hot wax dip.**

Super Secret top-ups cost around:

**60p to £1 / $0.60 to $1 per application.**

StripChip is a one-off £4 / $4 per new chain.

If you keep the waxing system for five years and wax every two weeks, the cost of the machine drops to roughly:

**\~70p / \~$0.70 per wax.**

So your total real-world cost per service interval?

Often around:

**£1 to £2 / $1 to $2.**

That’s less than a coffee.

And significantly less than prematurely replacing a £300 cassette. 

## Want To Lighten The Load?

If you’re ready to try the system, you can use my code:

**ROADBOOK15**

For 15% off at SILCA.

That takes the upfront cost down immediately.

Silence is speed.

And now it’s cheaper too.

## Final Thought

Hot wax is not candle science.

It is surface engineering.

Manchester to London proved durability.

Sa Calobra proved the margin.

Zero Friction Cycling proved the wear data.

Friction Facts proved the efficiency.

Tungsten disulfide explains the why.

If you are still running oil, you are not wrong.

You are just leaving seconds and lifespan on the table.

And sometimes, seconds change everything.

Maybe we’ll discuss leg waxing vs leg shaving in my next blog?
