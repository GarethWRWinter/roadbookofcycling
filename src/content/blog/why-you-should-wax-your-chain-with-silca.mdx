## Why you should wax your chain

Silca is a brand I have always adored due to their ability to make everyday cycling products extraordinary. They are modern innovators with old-world craftsmanship, and through their pursuit of perfection, Silca’s growing range of products elevates your entire cycling experience; whether you are tightening a bolt, waxing a chain, or pumping air into your tyres. A chore becomes a pleasure when you use a Silca product.

Our values are synergetic: Silca is focused on the future of cycling performance and function, yet never lose sight of their roots, which stem back to Milan 1917. Being a third-generation roadie, I respect cycling’s history, yet I hold the modern marginal gains mindset in my pursuit of progression.

My grandad used Silca pumps back in the day. Now I am honoured to carry the baton (If you have seen or used a Silca pump, you will know there is no finer way to blow air).

Although they are famed for toolmaking, one of Silca’s most significant products to date is [Super Secret Holt Melt Wax](https://amzn.to/48W8zUU) and [chain lubricant](https://amzn.to/4anEjF0).

I am so impressed by the results of [Silca’s Hot Melt Wax](https://amzn.to/48W8zUU) that I felt compelled to share my experience and help you find some gains this season.

I have been toying with chain waxes and high-performance lubricants for several years. Nothing comes close to the combination of immersing your chain in Silca’s Hot Melt Wax and topping it up with Super Secret Chain Lube — which can save an additional 5 watts compared to a standard drip lube.

Some of you might be thinking, “Only 5 watts? Is that really worth the effort?” Or, if you are a master of marginal gains, “Brilliant, sign me up!”

Whatever your outlook, I have discovered the benefits of chain waxing go far beyond fighting friction. Treating your drivetrain with Silca Super Secret can also increase the life of your drivetrain TEN TIMES — saving you time and money.

Whatever groupset you ride, waxing will improve its performance and preserve your pride and joy.

## My experience with wax

Chain waxing is one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to save watts (there are some very expensive ways to save far fewer watts…). Immersing a sterile chain in hot wax used to be quite a niche. However, due to the lofty friction-reducing stats and more user-friendly techniques, it’s becoming far more mainstream and accessible.

Manchester to London 2016 was a wet edition that drew my attention to wax's dirt and water-repelling properties. Listening to the grinding sounds of rival drive trains while mine was purring away gave me an extra morale boost. Nothing is more demoralising than a noisy chain mocking you with wasted watts.

## What makes Silca’s Hot Melt Wax so special?

It’s enriched with nano-scale tungsten disulfide. Secret Chain Blend not only acts as a lubricant but also modifies the surface of the chain, filling the micro imperfections of the metal with highly lubricious and wear-resistant tungsten disulfide particles.

## Chain waxing 101 — The process

### Sterilising the chain

Firstly, you need to sterilise your chain.
