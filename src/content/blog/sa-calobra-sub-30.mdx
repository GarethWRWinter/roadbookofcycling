Three attempts. Two failures. One lesson I’ll carry forever.

I’ve ridden Sa Calobra more times than I can count.  
Close enough to taste it. Never close enough to claim it.

Dangerously close to 30:00.

So I decided it was time to stop being a nearly man.

The plan was simple (which should’ve been the first warning sign):  
Arrive Monday. Ride sub-30 on Tuesday morning. Spend the rest of the week ripping Mallorcan limestone and being fully present with my family.

I’d done the training.  
Dialled the marginal gains.  
Left no obvious excuses.

What I underestimated… was what Sa Calobra demands when you ask it for everything.

## The Numbers (for context, not ego)

- **Distance:** 9.44 km  
- **Elevation gain:** 659 m  
- **Average gradient:** 7%

Sub-30 isn’t mythical.  
But it *is* a line in the sand.

## The Attempts

- **Monday:** DNF ✖️  
- **Tuesday:** 30:47 ✖️  
- **Friday:** 29:53 ✅  

Three rides.  
Two failures.  
A lot of learning.

## Fear of Failure (and why it matters)

Failure isn’t something to avoid — it’s the tuition fee.

When you commit fully to a goal, accept that you might get it wrong, and stay open to the lessons, you unlock a different level of resilience.

You don’t grow *despite* failure.  
You grow *because* of it.

What matters isn’t how hard you fall — it’s how honestly you assess what happened, and whether you’re brave enough to try again.

## Why Sub-30?

Because it matters to me.

Riding Sa Calobra in under 30 minutes is a solid benchmark — not elite, not pedestrian.  
A quiet nod from the mountain.

I’m a parent.  
I’m a Creative Director.  
My training time is limited and fiercely protected.

My window is 6–8 a.m.  
Intensity over volume.  
Turbo over café rides.

A 30-minute effort is the perfect goal for this phase of my life — specific, brutal, honest.

## Why I Ride (Still)

Everyone rides for different reasons: freedom, travel, friendship, headspace.

I ride for all of those — but at the core is this:

Cycling lets me test myself, repeatedly.  
It shows me progress — or lack of it — without lying.

It takes courage to show up daily for discomfort.  
To practise being uncomfortable on purpose.

Goals create focus.  
Focus creates consistency.

Halfway through a brutal VO₂ block, when everything in your body is begging you to stop, a clear goal is often the only thing that keeps the pedals turning.

Cycling feeds my obsessiveness.  
And I’m okay with that.

## Perspective: The KOM

Sub-30 feels small next to Tom Pidcock’s KOM: **22:46**.

I’ll never touch that — and I shouldn’t try to.

Comparing yourself to the world’s best is rarely healthy.  
Drawing inspiration from them *is*.

The only standard that matters:  
Be your best self, in the context of your own life.

## Prepare to Succeed

Working with Team Sky taught me the principle of *preparing to succeed*.

Not obsessively.  
Intelligently.

Failure to prepare is preparing to fail.

So I went all in.

## The Setup (because details matter)

- **Bike:** Factor O2 VAM (rim brake)  
- **Groupset:** Campagnolo Super Record 11-speed  
- **Wheels:** White Industries T11 / Sapim CX-RAY / Light Bicycle R25  
- **Tyres:** Michelin Power Cup  
- **Tubes:** Silca Latex  
- **Drivetrain:** 52×36 / 12×29, waxed Dura-Ace chain  
- **Computer:** Hammerhead Karoo 2  
- **Pedals:** Wahoo POWRLINK (dual-sided)  
- **Weight:** ~7 kg (yes, including questionable decisions)

Every bolt titanium.  
Bottle cages gone.  
Bar-end plugs gone.

I kept the vintage perforated leather bar tape and matching saddle — heavy, sentimental, irreplaceable.

I’m human, not a robot.  
Sometimes style beats watts.

## Aero (because it still counts)

- POC Ventral Air  
- POC Elicit  
- Le Col McLaren skinsuit  
- Aero socks (hideous, effective)  
- UDOG Cima climbing shoes  
- No HR strap — grams saved  

And always:  
My grandad’s 1949 TT medal.  
Hill climbs require a pendant.

## Fuel (simple, tested, trusted)

Coffee first. Always.

- Workshop Coffee (Aeropress)  
- Veloforte Forza bar  
- Veloforte Passo hydration  
- Veloforte Mela chews  
- Veloforte Doppio gel (before the final descent)

Nothing clever.  
Nothing untested.

## Attempt One: DNF

Everything was ready — except sleep.

Teething doesn’t respect taper weeks.

The roads were empty.  
The bike felt perfect.

Then — first hard hairpin — I kicked back into the saddle.

The seatpost twisted.

Adjusted.  
Dropped.  
Dropped again.

Target power became impossible.

The decision wasn’t heroic.  
It was smart.

Save the legs.  
Live to fight tomorrow.

## Attempt Two: 30:47

Seatpost fixed.  
Chain freshly waxed.  
Tyre pressure recalculated.

Target: **340 W @ ~95 rpm**

But as the clock ticked…  
I knew.

Too slow.

Back at the villa, the data told the truth:

- **Average power:** 325 W

The issue wasn’t fitness.  
It was execution.

Too many shifts.  
Too much cadence chasing.

I needed fewer decisions and more commitment.

Could I find 47 seconds?

Not 10%.  
Not 5%.

Maybe 3%.

## Attempt Three: 29:53

Worst sleep of the week.

At 3:30 a.m., standing in the kitchen, I stopped negotiating with doubt.

More caffeine.  
One last try.

Strava Live Segment on.  
Race myself.

At 6 km: **+60 seconds**

Then the gap closed.

I thought about my son.  
About showing up — even when it’s messy.

Final straight.  
400 W.  
Everything left.

Then the beep.

**29:53.**

Seven seconds clear.

Relief.

## What This Actually Means

I didn’t win a Tour stage.  
But I hit my standard.

As a parent.  
As a leader.  
As someone balancing ambition with presence.

That’s success.

Sub-29 is realistic.  
Sub-28? Why not.

Thanks for reading.  
Thanks for the support.
