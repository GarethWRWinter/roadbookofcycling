Do you know what really winds me up? When you're riding around in a beautiful environment, like here in Mallorca, and you see empty gel wrappers on the side of the road. It's inevitable in cycling hotspots — and a common sight on my home roads in the Surrey Hills _(even worse in Richmond Park)_.

I can forgive someone if they drop litter by accident. We've all been there. You know, when you pop a wrapper in your pocket, and it falls out when you pull ut your phone or something, and when you get home and empty your pockets, you realise your mistake. But I can't forgive ignorance. There is no clean-up crew, like at a grand tour.

When the sign says, “GEL”, you gel.

As cyclists, we should care more about our roads and environment, right? — this is our playground, and you don't shit where you eat.

I realise that I am not perfect, but I do everything I can to reduce the impact of my existence while still being able to enjoy what I love.

Since discovering Veloforte gels, I have converted into a 'gel person' — previously, I avoided _‘big-name branded gels’_ like the plague due to all the synthetics and artificial flavours found inside. Why are synthetic ingredients bad? Because they don’t digest properly. Our bodies are designed to absorb food, not fillers. Yes, a _‘typical gel’_ will provide you with the glucose that you need to perform, but it’s not good for your gut health and digestive system —especially if you use them regularly.

[Veloforte gels](https://veloforte.com/collections/energy-gels?gadid=&gclid=CjwKCAjwwdWVBhA4EiwAjcYJEAvHfSWtO1nf9_6GavQ4A1QLqDjJngA68Wg4w3jdCAnVFYF8uKEgwhoCKaIQAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=16445487266&utm_content=&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=) are different. They are made with natural ingredients, taste great, and deliver high-performance. They are going to improve your health, and not just your performance. When you're flagging or just keeping on top of your carb intake, nothing hits the spot like a Veloforte gel. But at the end of the day, you are still left with an empty wrapper.

I stick my empties up my shorts or in a designated pocket to avoid dropping one accidentally and take them home, rather than throwing them in the bin.

Then, I collect at least twenty Veloforte wrappers and post them _(for free)_ to:**"Veloforte Freepost"**— and they get sent to[TerraCycle](https://www.terracycle.com/en-GB/about-terracycle/our_recycling_process), where they turn the used wrappers into practical items, such as watering cans, storage containers, bins, tubes for, playground surfaces, etc.

Again, this is not perfect, but its progress. We are looking for a better solution for our packaging, something that is biodegradable. However, retail companies that stock our products demand a long shelf life, and biodegradable packaging doesn't quite meet the required standards. We are getting closer, so please be patient with us.

Rant over. Back to my Mallorca Road Journal…

Day 6:
------

I could feel my cornering and descending improving on the smooth limestone roads, my wind-cheating posture getting lower, and my climbing legs getting stronger. One week on this island is not long enough, but it’s long enough to impact your cycling positively.

At the end of my ride, I popped into[Pro Cycle Hire Mallorca](https://www.procyclehire.com/)to have a coffee with my friend Bruce and scrounge his track pump. Bruce has the coolest service vehicle, a bike museum inside his shop, and a great range of hire bikes. I bought my old C40 with me this year, but when I hire a bike, I always go and see Bruce because his bikes are well maintained, and he regularly updates his stable with the latest and greatest. In addition, Bruce takes out weekly shop rides if you’re looking for some company.

Right, so clearly, I had to work my way through the menu for the purpose of this journal — starting with the classic combo of chocolate and pistachio. If a Heladería can’t get them right, then there is no hope. Ca’n Noble absolutely nailed it and converted us from our usual spot around the corner. Each day we went back to try a different flavour. Their house special, rosemary and honey, is a sensation. Another notable mention is the black sesame seed — _if you are a fellow ice cream/gelato/helado connaisseur._

Day 7:
------

I was turning at the junction to Sa Calobra — when someone shouted, "Gareth!" I bumped into my old friend, Lars, who I used to ride with about eight years ago until he moved back home to Sweden. He was heading from Sóller to Formentor. I swear I see more people in Mallorca than I do on my home roads. I couldn't convince him to ride Sa Calobra with me, so we parted ways and met later for coffee to talk about the old days. That's the beauty of Mallorca; like-minded people gather from around the world.

I hard to go and say goodbye to Sa Calobra. It's one of my favourite climbs and places on this planet. I could feel my descending improving — it's mind-blowing how much you can improve with the right conditions. It was time to channel Jan Ullrich for the way back up.

“FULL GAS!” to the top, motor-paced by the gas man.

Early in the morning, while the sun is low, you can hide in the shadows of the mountain to stay cool. I have no idea how people climb this mountain in the midday sun. I’m Winter by name, winter by game.

I didn’t want to reach the top because that meant it was home time — but I had my baby mama waiting back at the villa for me, and we had a day of sea, sand and seafood planned.

When something is coming to an end you appreciate it more. With a week of riding in my legs, I’d had my blowout — and I could just sit up and enjoy the ride.

We headed to Formentor beach for a quick swim and to put our feet up before travelling home. I don’t have much time for reading these days, but I caught up on some Murakami, and I read Stevo Cummings book[“The Break”](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Break-Steve-Cummings/dp/1838953914/ref=asc_df_1838953914/?hvadid=535228099184&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1006886&hvnetw=g&hvpone=&hvpos=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvrand=4859535665837000851&hvtargid=pla-1481812816954&linkCode=df0&psc=1&psc=1&tag=googshopuk-21&th=1)— it’s brilliant, honest, inspiring and insightful. I recommend it.

My final recommendation is an authentic paella at[La Font del Gall](https://g.page/restaurantelafontdelgall?share)and the perfect way to end our babymoon and a well-earned feast after a week of hard graft. The squid ink paella is dense and tastes like the sea. It’s dark and smokey and unctuous _(my white shirt survived)._

</figure>


<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img17} alt="Image 17" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


And that concludes our babymoon. We timed our trip perfectly, as the day we arrived home was when the travel chaos began. Severely delayed flights and cancellations have been headline news for several weeks.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img18} alt="Image 18" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


Now it’s time for us to nest. With only 7/8weeks remaining, I cannot wait to meet our baby. Next time we fly to Mallorca, it will be as a family. What do you think, throw a baby seat on the back for added hill training? Or leave them with Becky on the beach?

Thanks for reading.
