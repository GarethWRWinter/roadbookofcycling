If you want a faster bike **and** less bike cleaning, chain waxing is the rare upgrade that genuinely delivers both.

This isn’t marginal-gains cosplay. Done properly, waxing gives you:
- **Lower drivetrain friction** (aka “free watts”)
- A **clean chain** you can touch without ruining your day
- **Longer drivetrain life** (chain + cassette + chainrings)
- Less time “maintaining” and more time riding

Below is the practical guide I wish most cyclists had before they wasted money on ten different lubes.

## The simple truth: what waxing changes (and why it matters)

A normal wet lube works by staying… wet. Which means it also stays sticky. Sticky means it collects grit. Grit turns your drivetrain into a grinding paste.

Wax works differently:
- It **coats** the chain
- It **dries** to a solid film
- Dirt doesn’t embed the same way, and it’s far easier to shed

Result: a drivetrain that runs smoother and stays dramatically cleaner.

## Who should wax (and who shouldn’t)

Wax is ideal if you:
- Ride in **mostly dry** conditions
- Care about **performance** or **cleanliness**
- Hate drivetrain gunk
- Don’t want to relube constantly

Wax is *not* ideal if you:
- Ride lots of **muddy/wet winter roads** and can’t be bothered with the extra steps
- Need a “spray something and forget it” approach

If you’re UK-based and ride year-round: you can still wax — you’ll just want a sensible wet-weather strategy (I’ll cover that below).

## The two waxing options (pick one)

### Option A — Hot melt waxing (best performance + cleanest)
This is the “do it properly” method:
1) Fully clean/degrease chain (once)
2) Melt wax
3) Drop chain in
4) Hang to cool
5) Ride
6) Re-wax periodically

**Pros:** cleanest, fastest, longest-lasting  
**Cons:** initial setup is more involved

### Option B — Drip wax (easiest, still excellent)
This is the “normal-person” method:
1) Fully clean/degrease chain (once)
2) Apply drip wax
3) Let it cure fully
4) Ride
5) Top up when needed

**Pros:** far easier, still very clean  
**Cons:** slightly less durable vs hot melt

## My recommended setup (the one I’d start with)

### The wax
- **Hot melt:** Silca Hot Melt (add your affiliate link)
- **Drip wax:** Silca Super Secret (add your affiliate link)

> Affiliate note: If you buy via my links, you support Road Book of Cycling at no extra cost to you.

### The “don’t overcomplicate it” tools
- A cheap **slow cooker** (dedicated to wax — do not cook chilli in it afterwards)
- A **master link plier**
- Nitrile gloves + shop towels
- A basic degreaser strategy (details next)

---

## The only hard part: stripping factory grease (do this once)

If you skip this, waxing will be mediocre. If you do it right once, everything becomes easy.

**Goal:** chain must be completely oil-free.

A practical method:
1) Put new chain in a jar with degreaser, shake hard
2) Repeat until fluid stays mostly clear
3) Final rinse with something that leaves no residue
4) Dry fully (bone dry)

If you want, I’ll give you a “UK-available product list” for the exact solvents that work without drama.

## How often should you re-wax?

This depends on conditions and mileage, but a good rule:
- **Hot melt:** every 250–400 km (dry), sooner if wet
- **Drip wax top-up:** every 150–300 km (dry)

Your chain will tell you:
- It sounds **dry** or slightly “sandpapery”
- Shifting feels slightly less crisp
- You see wax flaking and the chain looks under-coated

---

## Wet weather: the UK reality

Wax can handle “normal wet roads”, but:
- Long, filthy winter rides will shorten interval
- You may need more frequent top-ups

Two sensible approaches:
1) Stay waxed, just reapply more often in winter  
2) Have a **winter chain** you treat differently, and keep your “fast chain” waxed

---

## The payoff (why I still do it)

Waxing is one of the few bike upgrades that hits:
- **Performance**
- **Maintenance time**
- **Cleanliness**
- **Component lifespan**

If you care about any two of those, you should at least try drip wax. If you care about all four, go hot melt.

## Next: I’ll turn this into a repeatable “system”

On the blog, we’ll build:
- A dedicated **Drivetrain** category
- A short “Start Here” guide
- A product page for **Waxing Kit** (affiliate-ready)
- A winter strategy post (UK-specific)
