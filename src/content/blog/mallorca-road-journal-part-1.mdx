My interpretation of heaven is an endless climb. So why Mallorca and not the Dolomites? I keep coming back because the roads are like carpet, it's stunning, and there is enough elevation to satisfy my hunger.

Also, this wasn't a training camp. Here comes the announcement… it was our “babymoon”. Becky is six months pregnant, and this was our recovery before climbing the ultimate mountain — parenthood.

<figure class="rb-figure">

</figure>


_I have nicknamed this trip, “the Milk Race”_🍼_(jersey found in Pro Cycle Hire Mallorca)._

I give so much of my time and self to work and cycling — leaving Becky on the back foot _(sorry, babe)_. I find it very hard to switch off. My brain is always ticking, generating ideas, and continually optimising things. So this trip was important for me to disconnect and for us to reconnect.

Mallorca is perfect for us. I can get out at sunrise, do 2-4hrs in the colls, get back, have breakfast, and then spend all day together doing non-cycling things _(while I look jealously at everyone cycling past)._

This year, my lighthouse for guiding all decisions, actions and parenthood will come from the question, **“Is this authentically me?”**

Passing everything through the authentic filter has already helped me make some progressive changes, namely becoming the creative director of[Veloforte](https://veloforte.com/). I am eternally grateful for a long, broad, exciting and character-building career at Sky — it shaped me into who I am. But Veloforte runs deeper. It's not just my career. Helping athletes at all levels and disciplines get more enjoyment and performance from their sport has become my purpose _(which stemmed from Team Sky and British Cycling's "Inspiration to participation" narrative, where we inspired over a million people to start cycling in the UK)._

Nutrition is vastly overlooked, but it's the most fundamental way to improve health, wellbeing, recovery and performance. Veloforte is the world's finest nutrition. As a committed amateur athlete, an avid home cook, and a champion of real food vs synthetic/manufactured ingredients, **Veloforte,is undoubtedly authentic**. It's hugely rewarding to receive feedback about how much everyone loves our products — and cements that I am on the right path.

In 2020/2021, professional commitments consumed my intense training focus, **which is not me**. I was guilty of trying to do more rather than doing better. However, I am finding balance by focussing my time and energy on the people and projects that matter most — and have got my training back on track.

Mirador Formentor

You may be wondering what I am training for and what will I do when the baby comes?

Well, I train purely for the feeling of progression. Cycling channels my obsessive nature. For me, it's all about the hunt, not the kill. The chase, not the catch. The journey, not the destination. I am always looking forward, never looking back.

Also, cycling, training, and living a healthy lifestyle are essential to my psyche. I believe that self-prioritisation is equally selfless. By being my best self, I can be better for others. That is my mindset going into fatherhood. Yes, my baby and Becky will be my number one priority, but taking care of myself will enable me to better care for them.

I'm sure I have a lot to learn… but I believe in this value.

In terms of my training? Babies love white noise, right? So I'll sing them to sleep with my turbo trainer while dreaming of the roads in Mallorca.

Here's how my parents balanced childcare with cycling — and a little insight into my childhood:

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img06} alt="Image 6" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


Yes, that is my parents in the 80s charging down an A road on a tandem with a sidecar attached. I’ll stick to Zwift and a baby bouncer.

Mallorca Day 1:
---------------

The best way to kick-start Mallorca is with a little leg stretcher to the lighthouse. We always stay in Pollenca. It's our favourite town on the island. The ride to Cap de Formentor has enough elevation to wake up your legs, see the sights and take it all in after a day of travel.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img07} alt="Image 7" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img08} alt="Image 8" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


The final segment to the lighthouse was closed and guarded by a rather angry gatekeeper _(who didn't make the shot for obvious reasons)_. So, I headed to the Albercutx Watchtower to compensate.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img09} alt="Image 9" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img10} alt="Image 10" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


My 'leg stretcher' was a realisation of my training consistency. After I got back to my villa, mixed up a thick [NOVA recovery shake](https://veloforte.com/products/nova-recovery-protein-shake), and uploaded my ride to Strava — I discovered I had PR'd every segment of that ride.

I just look at my power and don't pay much attention to segments, but this indicates that I am doing something right.

I did a lot of damage to my cycling back in 2019/2020, trying to be something I am not by achieving a world tour power-to-weight ratio. A good goal, but I took it the wrong way and tried to lose more weight, rather than build more power.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img11} alt="Image 11" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


Now that I have refocussed my training and built more strength, I have learned that power-to-weight isn't the be-all and end-all of cycling.

It all goes back to being more authentic. I am a rouleur, a diesel engine, a jack-of-all-trades. I might not be the first to the top of a climb or road sign sprint, but I can roll with the punches, and I’ll always be the last one standing at the end of a long day. I would be a great domestique or one-day specialist if I did race _(a man can dream)_. But, now that I’m training my strengths and natural disposition, everything feels ‘right’ — and I am getting even more enjoyment from cycling.

Day 2:
------

Sa Calobra is my favourite climb on the island. It's not the biggest climb, but the snaking hairpins and endless views are iconic. You have to ping-pong the climb, as it's a dead-end port,but an "out and back" is my favourite kind of route — as It feels like you are going somewhere, and there are no shortcuts.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img12} alt="Image 12" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


I love this descent. Having spent the best part of two years mostly locked on a turbo trainer, I needed the practice. My cornering and descending have gone to shit.

Climbing Sa Calobra brings back many memories, namely riding up here with my dad in 2019. His doctor said he would struggle to walk without assistance due to leukaemia, DVT, a lung tumour, etc. But he defied his fate, and we eventually cycled up Sa Calobra together _(_[_Here’s the full story_](https://www.roadbookofcycling.com/blog/2019/4/29/mallorca-travelswithmyson)_, if you haven’t read it already)._

Back to the power-to-weight subject. Having smashed all of my previous Strava segments on the island, I expected to shave some time off my sub-30mins Sa Calobra PB. Instead, however, I was over six minutes slower.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img13} alt="Image 13" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


It would be easy to become disheartened by this, but digging a little deeper reveals a wealth of positives. In 2019 I was brilliant uphill for around 30-60mins, but that was about it. I was comparatively useless at everything else. Now I am far more versatile, back to my true self, and although the numbers are against me for a climb of this duration — they are on my side for everything else.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img14} alt="Image 14" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


On a side note _(here come the excuses)_, this time, I had a camera on my back, all of my tools and spares, food in my pockets, water in my bottle, a heavy old C40 from the 90’s with a Flemish compact _(53x39)_ alloy wheels, etc. Whereas setting my PB, I emptied my pockets and cages at the top of the climb and hid them in a bush, rode a lightweight bike from Pro Cycle Hire Mallorca with a compact chainset, and glass-cranked it from Pollensa to Sa Calobra, so I didn't waste any energy.

In 2019, I had my dad with me — so if anything went wrong, we had each other. When you ride solo in the early hours, you are alone and have to be self-sufficient. You need spare food, drink, tubes, and tools. Otherwise, you learn the hard way.

I am very happy with my progress, and my average power was still higher than my 2019 PB — and that is the only metric I am focussing on.

That's it for part 1. I'm just going to leave you with my essential travel items. Stay tuned for the second part of my Mallorca Travel journal, where I'll talk more about cycling and less about my introspection. I'll also share a few of my recommendations for restaurants, relaxation, coffee, ice cream, etc.

My essential travel items:
--------------------------

I think we have already established that condoms are not an essential travel item for me this year…

1. Veloforte
------------

Of course, Veloforte is my number one. As you know, I like to "control the controllables" — so travelling with the world's finest nutrition in your pockets is a godsend. You can reach in to find your familiar favourites conveniently packaged to help you [#fuelbetter](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/fuelbetter/?hl=en).

Here are just a few highlights from the wide selection that I brought with me:

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img15} alt="Image 15" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


### [MOCHA Protein Bar:](https://veloforte.com/products/mocha)

An all-day energy bar with 10g of plant-based protein. I get up early _(4-5am)_, and don't always feel like eating. So having something small and fortifying like MOCHA for breakfast solves this problem. I prefer to eat little and often rather than load up. So I'll usually have another after the first hour of riding. Honestly, I could live off of these.

### [FORZA Protein Bar:](https://veloforte.com/products/forza)

My reward for when the efforts are over and It's time to pedal gingerly back home. I love the refreshing fennel and apricot flavours of FORZA. It has 12g of protein from egg whites to initiate the recovery process — this is my favourite Veloforte product.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img16} alt="Image 16" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


### [SOLO Electrolyte Powder:](https://veloforte.com/products/solo-hydration-electrolyte-powder)

You quickly learn the importance of hydration and electrolytes when riding in hot conditions. You know, when you get back from a ride, and your kit is covered in dry sweat? Like these shots that I took of Damo at the Lincoln GP finish line.

The refreshing flavour of SOLO encourages you to drink more. It replenishes your electrolytes with powdered coconut water powder and pink Himalayan salt _(240mg potassium, 350mg sodium, and 5g of carbs)._

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img18} alt="Image 18" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


### [Primo Natural Energy Gel](https://veloforte.com/products/primo-natural-energy-sports-gel)

The performance benefits of beetroot are well documented. Veloforte gels are everything that conventional gels are not. They taste incredible _(I can often be found pouring our_[_TEMPO_](https://veloforte.com/products/tempo-natural-energy-sports-gel)_gel over pancakes)_, are made from 100% natural ingredients, deliver balanced carbs for rapid absorption _(fructose and glucose),_ and are low residue on your stomach.

### [NOVA Recovery Shake](https://veloforte.com/products/nova-recovery-protein-shake)

It's essential to consume protein and carbohydrates within 30mins after exercise. The carbs replenish your glucose and give your body a little insulin spike to help transport the protein to your muscles and kick-start muscle repair.

When you are doing consecutive days in the saddle, recovery is essential. After your hard work, a velvety-smooth chocolaty-thick shake, with complete plant-based proteins and a slight sweetness from the banana, is a rewarding treat. I often find that when I dig too deep, it kills my appetite — which is counterproductive to recovery. A shake is perfect for when I don't feel like eating. It puts the optimal amount of nutrients into my system until my appetite wakes up, and I become ravenous about an hour later.

2. Veloskin Chamois Cream
-------------------------

Veloskin chamois cream is produced with quality natural ingredients, such as Shea butter, orange oil and aloe vera, that provide a thick, luxurious and long-lasting chamois cream that protects and keeps harmful bacteria at bay _(one of the most significant contributors to saddle sores)._ Sweating in hot climates/conditions produces more bacteria and residue in your chamois area that can quickly develop into a sore without Veloskin.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img19} alt="Image 19" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


They also make travel sachets that are great for short trips, but I prefer to bring a tin for a week of riding. Their shave cream is equally exceptional. I always take a tin to keep the guns, and my face, gleaming.

3. Pelotan Suntan Lotion
------------------------

We are all looking for the "stick it on and forget about it" solution — whether that's a tyre choice or chain lubricant. [Pelotan SPF 30 suntan lotion](https://pelotan.cc/) has nailed the brief — all day sun protection for long days in the saddle.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img20} alt="Image 20" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


It smells fantastic, is easy to apply, glosses up the guns, and the roll-on version fits in your pocket if you need a top-up _(and is an excellent way to apply suntan lotion)._

4. Aeropress
------------

Life is too short to drink shit coffee. And sorry, Mallorca, your coffee is mostly shit. So I take an Aeropress and freshly ground coffee beans _(I store the grinds in a freezer to keep them fresh)_.

<figure class="rb-figure">
	<Image src={img21} alt="Image 21" width={2500} height={1667} />
</figure>


I think the Aeropress is the perfect compromise between espresso and pour-over. You can brew a full-bodied, clean cup of coffee with ease.

5. Aloe Vera
------------

Nature knows best. I use [organic Aloe Vera gel](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aloe-Pura-Body-Vera-200ml/dp/B081D87TC9?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1) to soothe and moisturise after a day in the sun, to treat insect bites, repel insects, and as a daily moisturiser. It's magical stuff.

6. Le Col Wallet
----------------

The [Le Col wallet](https://lecol.cc/products/cycling-wallet?variant=39411511263295) is big enough to fit a passport, payment cards, driver's licence, has a clip for keys and additional room for other bits and pieces, such as a small multitool or tyre levers etc. Then you just shove the whole thing in your back pocket. Easy.

What I wish I had brought:
--------------------------

I did okay this year. I remembered my cycling shoes. But if there were a few items I wish I had packed, these are the ones:

*   **Cable ties**— to zip up my hardshell bike box. To find a shop that sold them was harder than I thought…

*   **CO2** — I really didn't want to lug a track pump with me, so I scrounged [Pro Cycle Hire Mallorca's](https://www.procyclehire.com/)_(thanks, Bruce)_. Next time, I'll use CO2 to reinflate after I have rebuilt my bike out of the box.

*   [**POC Ventral Air**](https://www.pocsports.com/collections/cycling-helmets-road/products/ventral-air-mips?variant=41480991899800) — I took my Ventral, as I have been riding it all year, and it was to hand. I should have had the sense to dig out my Air, as it has far more ventilation. Even by 8am, Mallorca was a sweat fest. Also, when mosquitos fly into your helmet, there are more holes for them to escape...

*   **Orthopaedic pillow** —the pillows in our villa felt like they were stuffed frugally with rags. Once you experience [this pillow](https://www.groovepillows.co.uk/products/easy-sleeper), there is no going back.I always joke that I am “the princess and the pea” in all aspects of my life — especially with my sleep and bike fit.

My impression of a Brit abroad.

Thanks for reading. I hope I have imparted some wisdom, given a few ideas, or mildly entertained you for 20mins. Stay tuned for part 2.
