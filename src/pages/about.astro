					Roadbook of Cycling is where I write from inside the sport — where training meets equipment,
					where details become confidence, and where progress is earned rather than claimed.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cycling was never just a hobby in my family. It was culture. It was character. It was a way of
					measuring yourself honestly.
				</p>

				<SectionDivider label="My story" />

				<p>
					I can still hear my grandmother’s voice: her accent flipping from queen’s finest (when I was in her good books)
					to cockney (when I wasn’t). She was a working-class hero who saw the best in people — and travelled the world
					on two wheels.
				</p>

				<p>
					Nan bought her first bike in 1949 from Algurn Cycles in Wandsworth, London. It’s still hanging in my dad’s garage.
					In post-war Britain, cycling gave young people freedom when cars and money were scarce.
				</p>

				<p>
					My grandparents met through cycling clubs and racing. I still wear my grandad’s first gold medal on a pendant —
					from the year they met — to take him riding with me.
				</p>

						“You look good on a bike. Just as good as your dad. Nearly as good as your grandad.”

				<p>
					My parents met at a roller-racing event in Peckham. My schoolmates did Disneyland — I did UK cyclo-tours:
					camping in the rain, drinking river water, living on flapjacks. Cycling taught me hard work and persistence.
					It also taught me what matters: craftsmanship, preparation, and the ability to suffer well.
				</p>

				<SectionDivider label="Cycling × career" />

				<p>
					In 2010 I began my career in the creative industry at Sky News &amp; Sports. Broadcasting Sir Brad Wiggins’s Tour de France
					victory and Team GB’s dominance at London 2012 evolved into a full-time role in Sky’s cycling sponsorship team,
					where I grew to lead creative outputs.
				</p>

				<p>
					Working alongside performance teams — coaches, chefs, nutritionists, physios, psychologists — rewired my understanding
					of high performance. Environment matters. Systems matter. The unglamorous details matter.
				</p>

				<p>
					Those lessons shaped my approach to training and to work: prepare to succeed, iterate relentlessly, and never pretend
					that outcomes are luck.
				</p>

				<h2>Nutrition: the “food first” shift</h2>
				<p>
					Team environments taught me something simple and easily missed: real food isn’t just healthier — it performs.
					I stopped chasing “space-food” shortcuts and built a food-first approach that improved sleep, recovery, immunity,
					and power-to-weight.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also learned the hard way that it’s possible to chase a pro-level power-to-weight ratio by losing weight… and lose the power
					that made you fast in the first place. The rule I now live by: <strong>fuel and train</strong> — never <strong>diet and exercise</strong>.
				</p>

				<h2>Today</h2>
				<p>
					I’ve spent over a decade inside elite performance environments — including as Former Creative Director at Team Sky —
					contributing to systems that delivered Olympic gold medals, Tour de France and Giro d’Italia victories.
				</p>
				<p>
					I now lead creative strategy and performance systems at Mindvalley, focused on human optimisation and transformation
					at global scale.
				</p>

				<SectionDivider label="Partnership" />

				<p>
					I work with brands and teams who care about quality — the kind of partners who value craft, evidence, and long-term trust.
					If that’s you, we’ll get on.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Brand partnerships</strong> (content, product storytelling, and performance-led campaigns)</li>
					<li><strong>Consulting</strong> (creative strategy, positioning, and high-performance systems)</li>
					<li><strong>Speaking</strong> (marginal gains, discipline, and building environments that produce winners)</li>
				</ul>
