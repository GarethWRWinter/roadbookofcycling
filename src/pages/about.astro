    <p>
      I grew up with stories like that. Stories about grit, service, pride in
      craft, and doing things properly, even when no one is watching. Cycling was
      never just a sport in my family. It was culture. It was character. It was a
      way of measuring yourself honestly.
    </p>

    <p>
      That belief still shapes everything I do.
    </p>

    <h2>Cycling Was the Classroom</h2>

    <p>
      I came into professional cycling in 2012 as a creative, joining Team Sky at
      the very beginning of its journey. What followed was a decade inside one of
      the most successful high-performance environments modern sport has ever
      seen.
    </p>

    <p>
      I worked alongside athletes and leaders who redefined what preparation,
      discipline, and belief really look like.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sir Bradley Wiggins</li>
      <li>Sir Chris Hoy</li>
      <li>Geraint Thomas</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Under the guidance of Sir Dave Brailsford, I saw first-hand how marginal
      gains are not a slogan, but a way of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Olympic gold medals. Tour de France victories. Giro d’Italia triumphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      More importantly, I witnessed how elite systems are built. How small
      details compound. How culture beats motivation. How preparation creates
      confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those years shaped me far beyond cycling.
    </p>

    <h2>The Creative Role Inside Performance</h2>

    <p>
      My role sat at the intersection of creativity, communication, and
      performance. Translating complex ideas into clarity. Turning process into
      belief. Making excellence visible without cheapening it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cycling taught me that storytelling is not decoration. It is leverage.
      If people understand the why, they commit to the how.
    </p>

    <h2>Life Beyond the Team Bus</h2>

    <p>
      After Team Sky, I took on creative leadership roles that allowed me to apply
      elite performance thinking beyond the peloton.
    </p>

    <p>
      I served as Creative Director at Veloforte, helping shape the creative
      direction of a fast-growing performance nutrition brand rooted in real food
      and real athletes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I work at Mindvalley, leading creative and operational systems
      focused on human optimisation and transformation at scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Different arena. Same mindset.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Cycling Still Matters</h2>

    <p>
      I still ride because cycling remains the most honest mirror I know. It
      rewards patience. It exposes ego. It does not care about your excuses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chasing a personal best up Sa Calobra at sunrise teaches the same lesson as
      leading a creative team under pressure. Show up. Do the work. Learn fast.
      Stay humble.
    </p>

    <h2>A Voice Within the Cycling Kingdom</h2>

    <p>
      I write and share not to posture, but to contribute. To pass on lessons
      earned the hard way. To connect the dots between performance, creativity,
      and life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deep respect for heritage. Relentless curiosity for progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      An elder of the tribe, still riding. Still learning. Still obsessed.
    </p>

    <h2>Partnerships and Collaboration</h2>

    <p>
      I work with brands who value craft, credibility, and long-term thinking.
      Brands who understand that influence is earned through consistency, not
      volume.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are building something meaningful in cycling, performance, or human
      optimisation, and you value depth over hype, we will likely get along.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Word</h2>

    <p>
      I am a cyclist shaped by systems. A creative leader shaped by sport. A
      father shaped by perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still chasing improvement. Still honouring where it all came from.
    </p>
