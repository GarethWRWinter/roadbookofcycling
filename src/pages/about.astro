					I grew up with stories like that. Stories about grit, service, pride in
					craft, and doing things properly, even when no one is watching. Cycling
					was never just a sport in my family. It was culture. It was character. It
					was a way of measuring yourself honestly.
				</p>

				<p>That belief still shapes everything I do.</p>

				<h2>Cycling Was the Classroom</h2>
				<p>
					The bike is an honest mirror. It rewards patience, exposes ego, and
					punishes sloppy details. Do the work, get the result. Skip the work, pay
					for it.
				</p>

				<h2>Work, at the Highest Level</h2>
				<p>
					I’ve spent over a decade inside elite performance environments. Former
					Creative Director at Team Sky, working alongside Olympic champions and
					Grand Tour winners. Contributor to systems that delivered Olympic gold
					medals, Tour de France and Giro d’Italia victories.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now leading creative strategy and performance systems at Mindvalley,
					focused on human optimisation and transformation at global scale.

					Cyclist. Creative leader. Student of marginal gains.
